# 🎲 Monte Carlo Simulations Playground 🎲  

Welcome to the **Monte Carlo Simulations** repository! 🚀 This repo is a collection of Python-based simulations that use the **Monte Carlo method** to estimate probabilities, model real-world scenarios, and analyze randomness. Whether you're a **data scientist, mathematician, or just a curious coder**, this is the perfect place to explore the power of probabilistic simulations.

## 📌 What is Monte Carlo Simulation?  
Monte Carlo simulations rely on **random sampling and statistical modeling** to estimate numerical results that may be difficult (or impossible) to compute analytically. They are widely used in **finance, physics, engineering, AI, and probability theory** to solve problems with uncertainty and randomness.  

### ✅ Key Features of Monte Carlo Simulations:  
✔️ **Random Sampling:** Uses large numbers of random trials  
✔️ **Statistical Approximation:** Estimates probabilities when exact solutions are complex  
✔️ **Real-World Applications:** Used in decision-making, risk analysis, and scientific modeling

## 🚀 Included Simulations  

### 🎲 **1. Dice Roll Probability Simulation**  
- **Goal:** Estimate the probability of rolling a specific sum (e.g., **8**) when rolling **two six-sided dice**  
- **How It Works:**  
  - Simulates **100,000** dice rolls  
  - Counts occurrences where the dice sum equals the target  
  - Computes the probability and compares it to the theoretical value  
  - **Visualizes the results** with a **pie chart**

### 🎲 **2. Coin Toss Probability Simulation**  
**Goal:** Estimate the probability of getting heads or tails in a large number of coin flips.  
**How It Works:**  
- Simulates **100,000** coin flips using Monte Carlo methods.  
- Calculates the frequency of heads and tails.  
- Computes the probability of heads and tails.  
- **Visualizes the results** with:
  - A **pie chart** showing the probability distribution of heads and tails.  
  - A **bar chart** displaying the total occurrences of heads and tails.  
- Demonstrates the **Law of Large Numbers**, as the probability should converge to 50% for each outcome when the sample size is large enough.
